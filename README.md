## **Abstract**

**Background:** Serverless computing has gained significant popularity due to its scalability, cost efficiency, and abstraction of infrastructure management. However, a major challenge remains in the form of cold-start latencyâ€”a delay that occurs when serverless functions are invoked after an idle period, often caused by the initialization of application libraries. Localizing the source of this latency is particularly difficult due to the complex and dynamic nature of serverless applications.  
**Aims:** This research aims to (1) develop and evaluate a developer-oriented tool for precise, code-centric localization of library initialization inefficiencies contributing to cold-start latency, (2) systematically create a taxonomy of recurring antipatterns associated with these initialization inefficiencies, and (3) empirically assess the practical impact and utility of the tool on software development practices through developer studies.  
**Method:** We designed and implemented an inefficiency localization tool, **InitScope** tailored for Python-based serverless applications. The tool leverages dynamic profiling, specifically statistical sampling and call-path profiling techniques, to precisely attribute cold-start inefficiencies at the source-code level. Using this tool, we conducted an extensive manual analysis to systematically identify and classify recurring anti-patterns in library initialization that contribute significantly to cold-start latency. To empirically evaluate its practical effectiveness, we carried out a mixed-method study consisting of a survey of 30 experienced serverless developers, supplemented by follow-up interviews with six participants who used the tool.  
**Results:** The proposed approach, **InitScope**, for localizing cold-start inefficiencies at the source-code level significantly outperformed all baseline methods, achieving 83.3% higher Top-N accuracy. With inefficiencies localized by **InitScope**, our analysis identified four common library initialization antipatterns that significantly contribute to cold-start latency. Moreover, developer evaluations demonstrated the toolâ€™s effectiveness in localizing these inefficiencies, enabling targeted optimizations that substantially reduced latency and memory usage. At the same time, qualitative feedback highlighted enhanced developer awareness and encouraged more performance-conscious coding practices.  
**Conclusions:** The research proposed **InitScope**, for localizing cold-start inefficiencies for serverless applications and provides empirical evidence of prevalent library initialization anti-patterns and demonstrates the value of a profiling-driven, developercentric approach in mitigating cold-start latency. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating precise, code-level performance insights into serverless application development practices.

zip -r $(ZIP_FILE_NAME) handler.py
```

---

## **Deploy on AWS Lambda**

Use the following command to create the Lambda function. Replace the placeholders with actual values.
```bash
aws lambda create-function --function-name $(LAMBDA_NAME) \
--runtime $(RUNTIME) --role $(ROLE_ARN) --handler $(HANDLER) \
--zip-file fileb://$(ZIP_FILE_NAME) --timeout $(TIMEOUT) --memory-size $(MEMORY_SIZE) \
--environment $(ENV_VARS) --region $(AWS_REGION)
```

---

## **Execute the Application**

Use the command below to invoke the Lambda function in parallel (provide a valid `API_URL`):
```makefile
invoke-par:
	@echo "Invoking in parallel..."
	@for i in {1..$(INVOKE_COUNT)}; do \
		curl --request POST \
			--url $(API_URL) \
			--header 'Content-Type: application/json' & \
	done; wait
```
